			<h1 class="h1">Hey it's Alvaro</h1>

			<span class="bold">I'd love to work in your team.</span>
			<p>I've been designing for a good few years and I have learnt how to work at a startup doing everything from idea conceptualisation to front-end development, at web development agencies alongside front-end developers pushing code to production, and at large design teams, designing collaboratively, iterating and pitching ideas not only to stakeholders but to each of the designers on the team.</p>
			<p>Now I'm at this stage of my career where I want to learn more about products and what's behind the scenes, and following through the whole conception process up until it reaches the end user. In essence, I want to work shaping products around user needs. I love iterating, prototyping and making decisions based on user feedback and analytics, and I believe I can enjoy doing these in your team.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>About myself...</strong> I consider myself a designer, not specifically UI, visual, interaction... I like designing experiences by diving into data and doing research, quickly creating and testing prototypes with users, designing and timing the interactions, and working with the developers to make sure that the output is spot on.</p>
			<p><strong>My toolkit</strong> consists primarily in paper and pencil for wireframing, Sketch and Photoshop for designing, Principle and InVision for quick prototyping, and HTML/CSS for responsive design prototyping or production.</p>

			<p class="grey">Rise is a startup accelerator run by Barclays. They run cohorts for fintech startups and they have coworking spaces in London, New York, Cape Town, Mumbai, etc... </p>
			<p>I was the only designer, and my role was designing the website from a brief and building it, all in a single two-week sprint.</p>

			<p class="grey">Barclays colleagues currently use BarclaysNow, a internal colleague platform. The new Digital Colleague Experience is the new platform that will replace this, being design natively for Android and iOS devices, and completely responsive.</p>

			<p>I was one of five designers, three visual and two UX, under a design principle and working alongside a project manager and a project owner. This work was for a Sprint 0. My tasks included designing the Home, News and Manage sections, as well as designing and prototyping the mobile app.</p>

	    	<p>To pitch the mobile design to stakeholders we needed a mobile prototype that was engaging, showed how some of the transitions and interactions would work. In the end, making sure that the experience was there, and it wasn't just a slideshow. For the prototype I used Principle, which ended up being the perfect tool to use for this purpose. Find a video of the prototype below:</p>

			<h3 class="h3">UVD's agency website</h3>
			<p class="grey">UVD is a web development agency based in Brick Lane working with startups.</p>

			<p>I was in charge of the redesign of the agency’s website, including interaction design, UX, photography and front-end development, working alongside a full-stack developer.
			<br>As a result of the redesign, after 4 months of its release the business enquiries had increased 100% compared to the same period the previous year.</p>

			<h3 class="h3">Vote for Policies</h3>
			<p class="grey">Vote for Policies is a responsive web application where you could complete a survey in order to make an informed decision about who to vote for at the 2015 general election.</p>

			<p>As the only designer in a team of 4, including a front-end developer and two back-end developers, I worked on branding, UX and UI design, and collaborated on the frontend development.</p>

		<section class="work_comment w70">
			<p>The biggest challenge was that the policies couldn't be edited, which meant that we had to work with lots of content. The 2010 service suffered from a lot of drop-off’s (45%) as so much content had to be read.</p>
			<p>We created rapid prototypes to test different versions of the survey on end users and worked iteratively following feedback to establish the best UI/UX not only in terms of usability, but to ensure that users were reading all the information and making informed decisions when choosing policies.</p>

			<h3 class="h3">RowActiv</h3>
			<p class="grey">RowActiv is a British Rowing digital product for indoor rowing machines within gyms, delivering tailored workouts to target personal goals.</p>

			<p>As the only designer in a team of 4, including a front-end developer and two back-end developers, I worked on branding, UX, UI and interaction design.</p>

		<section class="work_comment w70">
			<p>The big challenge we had with designing a product for use in gyms was making it stand out from all the other equipment, whilst ensuring it was accessible to all gym goers</p>
			<p>In order to make it simple and appealing, I wanted to avoid using a graph or data heavy interface, so decided on a big target bubble in the middle of the screen that grows and shrinks depending on users’ rowing power, and changes colour if they’re not on target.</p>
			<p>Focussing on the required intensity with minimal other distractions, users tend to engage more during the workout which in turn reduces boredom (a problem identified with existing indoor rowing).</p>
			<p>In further developments we introduced a progress indicator to manage progress expectations, and scoring feedback to further encourage the competitiveness and gaming aspect.</p>
